    1. List and explain different PowerBi products?
    - Power BI is a business analytics service provided by Microsoft that allows users to create interactive reports and dashboards using data from various sources. It offers a range of products and tools for data analysis and visualization, including the following:
    1. Power BI Desktop: A desktop application that allows users to connect to data, create reports and dashboards, and publish them to the web or share with others.
    2. Power BI Service: A cloud-based service that allows users to access and collaborate on reports and dashboards created using Power BI Desktop or the Power BI mobile app.
    3. Power BI Mobile: A mobile app that allows users to access and interact with reports and dashboards on the go.
    4. Power BI Report Server: A on-premises version of the Power BI Service that allows organizations to host and publish reports and dashboards on their own servers.
    5. Power BI Premium: A premium version of the Power BI Service that offers advanced features and capacity for larger organizations.
    6. Power BI Embedded: A set of APIs and tools that allow developers to embed Power BI reports and dashboards into their own applications.
    
    2. What limitations of Excel, Microsoft solved by PowerBi?
    1. Data size: Excel is limited to handling large amounts of data, as it can only handle up to 1 million rows of data. Power BI, on the other hand, can handle much larger datasets, making it better suited for working with large volumes of data.
    2. Data visualization: Excel provides a limited set of charts and graphs for data visualization, whereas Power BI offers a wider range of visualization options and allows users to create more sophisticated and interactive visualizations.
    3. Data connectivity: Power BI allows users to connect to a wider range of data sources, including databases, cloud services, and APIs, whereas Excel is limited to working with data from spreadsheets and text files.
    4. Collaboration: Power BI provides features for collaboration and sharing, such as the ability to publish dashboards and reports to the web and collaborate on them with others. Excel does not have these types of collaboration features.
    
    3. Explain PowerQuery?
    - Power Query is a feature in Microsoft Excel and Power BI that allows users to import, transform, and clean data from various sources. It provides a range of tools and features for data cleansing and transformation, such as the ability to filter and sort data, merge and append data from multiple sources, and apply transformations and calculations to data.
    
    4. Explain PowerMap?
    - Power Map is a data visualization tool in Microsoft Excel that allows users to create interactive 3D maps and visualizations of data. It allows users to plot data on a map and customize the appearance of the map, including the type of map, the data points, and the color scheme.
    
    5. How powerBi eliminated the need to host SharePoint Server on premises?
    - One way in which Power BI has eliminated the need to host SharePoint Server on premises is by providing a cloud-based service that allows users to access and collaborate on reports and dashboards from anywhere with an internet connection. This eliminates the need for organizations to host and maintain their own SharePoint servers and infrastructure, which can be expensive and time-consuming.
